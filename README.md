## Design Decisions

- Used `BeautifulSoup` to extract clean content from HTML.
- Used `TF-IDF` and cosine similarity for semantic search.
- Streamlit provides a clean, user-friendly interface.
- Modular code with separate components for crawling, indexing, and answering.
5. 🚧 Known Limitations

## Known Limitations

- Some JavaScript-rendered sites are not fully supported.
- No authentication support for private documentation.
- Semantic search may return approximate matches.

✅ Optional but Recommended
✅ Add a LICENSE (e.g., MIT if allowed).

✅ Include a small screenshot.png of the app running.

✅ Make sure it’s under 100–150 lines and cleanly formatted.

✔️ Final Note
If you want, I can generate the full README.md file for you tailored to your codebase — just say “yes”.

Otherwise, compare your README with the checklist above. If it covers all these parts, yes — it’s absolutely OK for submission!
